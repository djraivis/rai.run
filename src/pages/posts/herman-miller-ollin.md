I'm currently using a 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro as my main machine.
I want to use its display as a second monitor instead of using it in clamshell mode.
By using a monitor arm, you can get space under the laptop, and it allows you to adjust the angles and heights flexibly, depending on your task.

I use the second monitor for playing music, watching YouTube videos, or displaying ChatGPT.
Also, I display a second window of my note-taking app Inkdrop so I can quickly jot down my daily journal anytime.
