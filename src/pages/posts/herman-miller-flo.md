I've been using the Ergotron MXV for 4 years and have mostly been happy with it.
However, since the back of my monitor is visible when I give talks with screencasts due to my video style, I wanted a better-looking monitor arm.
I came across a monitor arm by Herman Miller and it has received good reviews.
So, I decided to buy it.
I would recommend the [Ergotron MXV](https://amzn.to/3xTzi5N) to those who don't care about appearance.

It pivots and moves smoothly, yet remains stable.

It's no problem even if you head-bang.
