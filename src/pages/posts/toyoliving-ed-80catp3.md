As you may know, Japan experiences very high humidity in the summer.
If you are into vlogging, you will need a proper way to store your camera gear to prevent mold.
I have been using moisture-proofing and fungicide in my storage, but I decided to purchase a camera storage unit.

Not only does it prevent mold, but it also features a nice transparent door and shelves, which provide quick access to your gear.

By default, it doesn't have rollers.
So, I bought custom rollers that are compatible with it.

It comes with a LED light.
