I wanted to mount my PC and subwoofer underneath the tabletop.
The cable management for them under the standing desk was pretty hard because it required longer cables.
However, there was room to mount them on the back of the tabletop.
I discovered hanging parts from a Japanese manufacturer named Preducts.

  - ¥12,100
- PC Mount × 1
  - S - 30cm / Black
  - ¥11,000
- Gadget Mount × 1

The hanging parts are stable enough.
Happy with the quality so far.

Unfortunately, they don't ship worldwide at the moment. I asked them if they plan to start shipping to other countries, but I didn't get an answer from them.
